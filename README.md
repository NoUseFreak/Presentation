Presentation
============

Presentation is an experimental tool to give presentations remote using a master control panel for all slideshows.

## Usage

Start the server in your terminal.
```
php bin/server.php
```

Open the master by browsing to ```/master.php```.
Open as many clients as you want by browsing to ```/```.

Note: Surfing to the services by ip will prevent any DNS issues you may encounter.
